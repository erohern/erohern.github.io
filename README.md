I have worked on several coding projects in python and java. Please click on the associated codes and movies. 

## Flappy Bird AI

In this project, I trained a neural network to learn how to play the videogame, “Flappy Bird,” where a flying bird tries to navigate through a maze.

## Molecular Dynamics simulations of rigid disks

In this project, I developed a molecular dynamics simulation of colliding elastic disks. The user can pre-select the number of disks in a fixed area.  These simulations can be used to study atomic liquids, bacteria, and other biological systems. 

## Molecular Dynamics simulations of rigid squares

In this project, I developed a molecular dynamics simulation of colliding, non-rotating squares. The user can pre-select the number of squares in a fixed area. In the future, I will implement rotational motion.

## I am working through coding problems posted on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

Several example problems and the solutions I obtained are listed below.
