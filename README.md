I have worked on several coding projects in python and java. Please click on the associated codes and movies. 

## Flappy Bird AI

In this [project](https://github.com/erohern/FappyBirdAI.git), I trained a neural network to learn how to play the videogame, “Flappy Bird,” where a flying bird tries to navigate through a maze.

Initial trial:

## Molecular Dynamics simulations of rigid disks

In this [project](https://github.com/erohern/SquareMD.git), I developed a molecular dynamics simulation of colliding elastic disks. The user can pre-select the number of disks in a fixed area.  These simulations can be used to study atomic liquids, bacteria, and other biological systems. 

## Molecular Dynamics simulations of rigid squares

In this [project](https://github.com/erohern/SquareMD.git), I developed a molecular dynamics simulation of colliding, non-rotating squares. The user can pre-select the number of squares in a fixed area. In the future, I will implement rotational motion. See the video below for an example.

## I am working through coding problems posted on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

Several example problems and the solutions I obtained are listed below. Codes can be found [here](https://github.com/erohern/ProjectEuler.git).

- If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3,5,6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Output: 233168

- Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms would be: 1-2-3-5-8-13-21-34-55-89... By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Output: 4613732

- The prime factors of 13,195 are 5, 7, 13, and 29. What is the largest prime factor of 600, 851, 475, 143?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Output: 6857

- A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91*99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Output: 906609

- 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Output: 232792560

- The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is: 1^2+2^2+3^2+4^2+...+10^2 = 385. The square of the sum of the first ten natural number is: (1+2+3+4...+10)^2 = 3025. Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025-285 = 2640 Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Output: 25164150

- By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13. What is the 10,001 prime number?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Output: 104743

- A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which, a^2 + b^2 = c^2. For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2. There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. Find the product of abc.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Output: 31875000

- The sum of the primes below 10 is 2+3+5+7 = 17. Find the sum of all the primes below two million.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Output: 142913828922

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Output: Greatest product of four adjacent numbers: 70600674

- The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1+2+3+4+5+6+7=20. The first 10 terms would be: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55... Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:  <br />
        1: 1 <br />
        3: 1,3 <br />
        6: 1,2,3,6 <br />
     	 10: 1,2,5,10 <br />
     	 15: 1,3,5,15 <br />
     	 21: 1,3,7,21 <br />
     	 28: 1,2,4,7,14,28 <br />
We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five factors.  What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors? Find the sum.
