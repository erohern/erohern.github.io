Here are a list of projects I have worked on.

## Flappy Bird AI

In this project, I trained a neural network to learn how to play the game "Flappy Bird".

## Molecular Dynamic Simulations of Rigid Squares

In this project, I developed python codes to simulate a collection of rigid squares moving in a confined space.
